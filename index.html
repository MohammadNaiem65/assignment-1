        <h1>Our Donation Plan</h1>
        <p>The list changes as requests are filled, and new needs are identified by support organisations providing aid
            and relief. 100% of publicly donated funds will be used to purchase exactly what's needed by people and
            communities impacted by storms and flooding.</p>

                <h4>Food for a Family</h4>
                <p>A 3- to 5-day supply of food and water can be stored in a relatively small area to provide some
                    security in case of disaster and the subsequent loss. A package for this will cost about 400 to 500
                    taka.</p>

                <h4>Shelter for a family</h4>
                <p>Shelter means protection during period of crisis. This is why we are spending a good amount of money
                    to help the flooded make their houses. Per family, it costs from 10k to 20k the start the initial
                    stage of making their houses.</p>

                <h4>Education for a child</h4>
                <p>During the monsoon, the community's children find it immensely difficult to go to schools since the
                    water level rises
                    and connecting roads get inundated. Most of them have lost their books and other accesories. And
                    this will cost about 2k taka per children.</p>

            <h1>Donate your old Cloths</h1>
            <p>We buy a lot of clothes throughout the year. And if we notice, a good amount of clothes lie untouched in
                our wardrobes. Why dump them when there are millions of under-privileged people in this world struggling
                to get enough bread to live for the next day, enough rag to cover themselves away from humiliation and
                enough shelter that promises them some hope for tomorrow. Don't dump, rather donate old clothes. There
                are so many victims of floods. whose future can be made by giving your small donation of old clothes.
                The best way to tidy any clothes and shoe collection is through donating. Donating is an essential and
                transparent way to help needy people.</p>

            <p>Charity is defined as giving resources like time and money without expecting anything in return. This
                selfless giving serves the most vulnerable in society and helps ensure that peoples human rights and
                needs are met Organizations built on this belief are nonprofits, which means they don't benefit
                financially from donations intended for the causes they serve. Charities have existed for hundreds
                of years in various forms. Today, you can find charities for countless causes focusing on health,
